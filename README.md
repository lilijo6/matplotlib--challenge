# Matplotlib-Challenge
Pymaceuticals Analysis
Using Pandas, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook analiyze the data and create visualizations.

* Create a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Create a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Create a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Create a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
* Include 3 observations about the results of the study.
